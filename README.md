##questions
1) What bikes are getting used in a certain area? 

2) What is the bike usage rate over a day and/ or week?

3) How many bikes are parked in "official" (SDOT bike racks) locations?
  - This is done by gathering data from the LimeBike API and SDOT bike rack data and seeing the overlap. This data is focused on the downtown area as UW owns its own bike racks and does not make their location data available for our use. This is important to know because if LimeBikes are not parked in areas specified for bike parking then they are likely to be an obstruction for pedestrians, particularly if they are left on sidewalk ramps or other areas that make public spaces accessible for people with disabilites. 
  - Users are able to select the data they would like to see; bike location, rack location, or both. They also have a table below that shows how many racks and bikes there are in the area and how many bikes are parked at racks and how many are not.
